# Proxy-Scraper
Web Scraper that collects proxies from multiple free proxy websites and outputs them into a text file in the location of the program.

# Created by XLRA

# Setup
git bash to a folder or download zip (easier) and set up in a folder. Running it in vscode would be easy but file location outputs directly to where the source file is located.

# Usage
On startup the program will load and options for proxies will pop up on a terminal based interface with a number select for different type of proxies. This includes Http/Https, socks4, and socks5 proxies. There's an alternate option for all of them which will compile all the proxies into a single text file. Entering the digit for the specified proxy will output the proxies in a text file with the name of the proxy.
