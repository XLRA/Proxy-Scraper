# Proxy-Web-Scraper
Web Scraper that collects proxies from multiple free proxy websites and outputs them into a text file in the location of the program.

# Created by XLRA

# Setup
Git bash to a folder or download zip (easier) and set up in a folder. Running it in vscode would be easy but the main program location outputs the text file with proxies directly to the same location.

# Usage
On startup the program will load and options for proxies will pop up on a terminal based interface with a number select for different type of proxies. This includes Http/Https, socks4, and socks5 proxies. There's an alternate option for all of them which will compile all the proxies into a single text file. Entering the digit for the specified proxy will output the proxies in a text file with the name of the proxy.

Your antivirus will try to stop the creation of the text file with the proxies because most antiviruses block free proxy list websites. I recommend you disable it for this then re-enable after you get your proxies.
