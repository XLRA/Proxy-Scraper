# Proxy-Web-Scraper
Proxy-Web-Scraper is a project that aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to gather proxy IP addresses from multiple free websites. This web scraper tool automates the process of collecting proxies and compiles them into a single, easy-to-use text file.

# Setup
To use this program, you can either download the zip file and set it up in a folder or use Git Bash to clone the repository to a folder. Once set up, running the program in Visual Studio Code is straightforward. However, it is worth noting that the output text file with the proxies will be generated in the same location as the program's main file. This program provides a simple and efficient solution for gathering proxy IP addresses from multiple free websites.

# Usage
When you start the program, a terminal-based interface will appear, providing options for selecting proxy types. The interface includes a number selection for HTTP/HTTPS, Socks4, and Socks5 proxies. You can also choose the "All" option to compile all the available proxies into a single text file. Once you enter the digit for the desired proxy type, the program will output the corresponding proxies into a text file named after the proxy type.

Your antivirus will try to stop the creation of the text file with the proxies because most antiviruses block free proxy list websites. I recommend you disable it for this then re-enable after you get your proxies.
